# Credit-Risk-Modelling

This project is to build a credit risk model, validate and monitor the model. 

The data considered is from lending club, for the period of 2007 to 2014. The model will be trained based on it.

This algorithm tries to model the probablity of default (PD) for the loan portfolio. The PD model is a Logistic Regression mmodel and later we will also experiment with XGBoost to incorporate more accuracy.
